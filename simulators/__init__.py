"""
Process simulators for different industrial control scenarios.

Organized by difficulty level:
- easy_processes: Simple, fast-responding processes (flow, pressure, motor control)
- medium_processes: Moderate complexity with some delays (temperature, pH, level)
- difficult_processes: Complex, slow processes with significant delays (distillation, furnace)
